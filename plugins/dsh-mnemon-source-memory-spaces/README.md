# dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces

Memory Spaces owns its Provider contracts and private child-Fiber host. Provider authors depend on `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces/provider-sdk`, never on the main repository's controllers or global registry.

The Source owns its storage registry, scoped native command transport, recall policy, routing, receipts and management operations. It imports **no Provider implementation** and defines no extra Context service. Each mount defaults to a separate data directory; set `dataDir` explicitly to select an existing authority.

Install the chosen Provider packages and configure them explicitly on the Source entry:

```yaml
name: dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces
config:
  dataDir: /absolute/path/to/memory
  providers:
    - use: dsh-mnemon-provider-holographic
      instanceId: local-facts
```

The host must already provide `ctx.mnemonMemory`; a Strategy decides how this Source enters the LLM View. For programmatic composition, import `installMemorySpaces` and pass explicit typed child modules. Omitting the child list is an error, not automatic dependency discovery. The default `dsh-mnemon` bundle supplies the existing nine Providers and old storage settings separately.

Run `pnpm install && pnpm verify` in this directory. Its own tests mount real Cordis Fibers and exercise Source isolation, scoped management, View actions/routes, persistence and failed-child cleanup. Provider authors can use `createMemorySpaceProviderFixture` from the public `/testing` entry for driver-level tests, then test their child inside this Source.

The compatibility export `dsh-mnemon/source-memory-spaces/provider-sdk` forwards to the same implementation. It does not turn Providers into Core contributions.
