# dsh-mnemon-source-runtime

Owns USER / MEMORY records, exact revisions, branch filtering, bounded projection and local capacity maintenance.

## Use

The `dsh-mnemon` Starter installs and mounts this Source by default. The package alone does not activate an instance or select a Strategy.

For a custom Profile, mount an explicit Entry after the Host's `ctx.mnemonMemory` service is available:

```yaml
- id: personal-runtime
  name: dsh-mnemon-source-runtime
  config:
    dataDir: /absolute/path/to/personal-memory
```

Choose an existing data authority deliberately. Without `dataDir`, each stable Source instance uses an isolated directory under `~/.mnemon/sources/`; the default Starter supplies the existing product paths. Replacing the default Source or adding a second instance requires an explicit selection Strategy, not a second implicit default role.

Disabling participation does not delete stored entries. Source data remains separate from the current turn's projection and access grants.

## Source-owned UI and tests

The optional `./client` entry is an ordinary DSH Client plugin. This package owns its pages and `presentation/` resources and uses `dsh-mnemon/client` for the shared frame and scoped management client. It never receives a Host Context, credentials or another Source's controller.

From a source checkout, install the declared dependencies and run `pnpm verify` to check Host behavior, Source-backed page interactions and Host/browser artifacts. Unreleased SDK work consumes a packed `dsh-mnemon` peer, not repository aliases or copied root tests.
